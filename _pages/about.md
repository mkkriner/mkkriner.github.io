I am a PhD Candidate in the Government Department at Cornell University and a Civil War Paths Fellow at the Centre for the Comparative Study of Civil War. 

My research is broadly in the areas of international relations and comparative politics. More specifically, my work is on UN peacekeeping/peacebuilding and foreign security assistance. My dissertation project, "Autocrats Keeping Peace? An Analysis of the Impact of Autocratic T/PCCs on UN Peace Operations," explores the impact of the participation of peacekeepers from autocracies on UN peacekeeping.

I earned an MS in Global Affairs from NYU's [Center For Global Affairs](https://www.sps.nyu.edu/homepage/academics/divisions-and-departments/center-for-global-affairs.html) and a BA in Global Studies from [Providence College](https://www.providence.edu/). I am also a former Graduate Fellow of the [Gender and the Security Sector Lab](https://www.sabrinamkarim.com/gsslab), PI Dr. Sabrina Karim, USIP-Minerva Peace Scholar, and RAND Summer Associate.
