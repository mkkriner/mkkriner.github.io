I am currently on administrative leave from [SAMHSA](https://www.samhsa.gov/), after joining the Agency in November 2024. As a result, I am currently seeking employment! 

I earned my PhD in Government from Cornell University, where I majored in International Relations and minored in Comparative Politics. During my time at Cornell, I was also a Graduate Fellow at the [Gender and the Security Sector Lab](https://www.sabrinamkarim.com/gsslab), PI Dr. Sabrina Karim.

My research is broadly in the areas of international relations and comparative politics. More specifically, my work focuses on UN peacekeeping/peacebuilding and foreign security assistance. My dissertation project, "Autocrats Keeping Peace? An Analysis of the Impact of Autocratic T/PCCs on UN Peace Operations," explores the impact of the participation of peacekeepers from autocracies on UN peacekeeping. 

For my dissertation, I conducted quantitative analyses (primarily using R) as well as qualitative comparative case studies on South Sudan and the Central African Republic. I also designed an original survey experiment on Qualtrics that I conducted with the Zambia Police Service. I traveled to Zambia in the summer of 2023 to complete the survey with a team of enumerators and captured over 400 responses from police officers. 

I earned an MS in Global Affairs from NYU's [Center For Global Affairs](https://www.sps.nyu.edu/homepage/academics/divisions-and-departments/center-for-global-affairs.html) and a BA in Global Studies from [Providence College](https://www.providence.edu/). I am also a former [Civil War Paths Fellow](https://www.civilwarpaths.org/) at the Centre for the Comparative Study of Civil War, USIP-Minerva Peace Scholar, and RAND Summer Associate.
