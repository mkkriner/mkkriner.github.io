I am a PhD Candidate in the Government Department at Cornell University and a USIP-Minerva Peace Scholar for the 2022-23 AY. 

My research is broadly in the areas of international relations and comparative politics. More specifically, my work is on UN peacekeeping/peacebuilding and foreign security assistance. My dissertation project, "Autocrats Keeping Peace? An Analysis of the Impact of Autocratic T/PCCs on Peace Operations," explores the impact of the participation of peacekeepers from autocracies on UN peacekeeping.
