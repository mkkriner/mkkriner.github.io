I am currently on administrative leave from [SAMHSA](https://www.samhsa.gov/), after joining the Agency in November 2024 and being illegally let go in February 2025. As a result, I am currently seeking employment! 

I received my PhD in Government from Cornell University, where I majored in International Relations and minored in Comparative Politics. During my time at Cornell, I was also a Graduate Fellow at the [Gender and the Security Sector Lab](https://www.sabrinamkarim.com/gsslab), PI Dr. Sabrina Karim.

My research is broadly in the areas of international relations and comparative politics. More specifically, my work is on UN peacekeeping/peacebuilding and foreign security assistance. My dissertation project, "Autocrats Keeping Peace? An Analysis of the Impact of Autocratic T/PCCs on UN Peace Operations," explores the impact of the participation of peacekeepers from autocracies on UN peacekeeping.

I earned an MS in Global Affairs from NYU's [Center For Global Affairs](https://www.sps.nyu.edu/homepage/academics/divisions-and-departments/center-for-global-affairs.html) and a BA in Global Studies from [Providence College](https://www.providence.edu/). I am also a former [Civil War Paths Fellow](https://www.civilwarpaths.org/) at the Centre for the Comparative Study of Civil War, USIP-Minerva Peace Scholar, and RAND Summer Associate.
